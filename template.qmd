## Introduction

Reproducible research is an essential paradigm that promotes the idea that scientific investigations should be transparent, verifiable, and accessible to others. In an era where the scientific community faces concerns about the replicability of research findings, adopting reproducible research practices becomes imperative.

This document uses @quarto.


## Key Benefits of Reproducible Research

- _Increased Credibility_: Transparent and reproducible research enhances the credibility of scientific findings, as others can independently verify and validate the results.
- _Collaboration and Iteration_: Open sharing of code and data facilitates collaboration among researchers and allows for the iterative improvement of studies over time.
- _Efficient Communication_: Reproducible research documents serve as comprehensive and self-contained artifacts, aiding in effective communication of methodologies and results.

## Method

### Getting started

1. Install [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).
2. You may need to install Public Sans font if you do not have it. You can find it [here](https://github.com/anuopensci/quarto-anu-report/tree/main/_extensions/anu-report/assets/webfonts).
3. The easiest way to edit and render the document is using the [RStudio IDE](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). If you prefer not to install R, then you can use VS Code instead.
4. From the Terminal run the following command
```bash
quarto use template anuopensci/quarto-anu-report
```



## Conclusion


This report underscores the transformative impact of reproducible research on the scientific landscape, promoting a commitment to openness and accountability for the benefit of the entire research community.
